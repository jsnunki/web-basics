    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>
    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>

    <ul>
      <!-- Add <li> elements here -->
      <li>
        Absolute links, like to
        <!-- It’s usually a better idea to reserve absolute links only for directing users to a different website. -->
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
          >Mozilla Developer Network</a
        >, which is a very good resource for web developers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Relative links, like to our <a href="misc/extras.html">extras page</a>.
      </li>
      <!-- “Relative” links point to another file in your website from the vantage point of the file you’re editing. -->
      <!-- This won't work for our local HTML files -->
      <li>
        Root-relative links, like to the <a href="/">home page</a> of our
        website, but those aren't useful to us right now.
      </li>
      <li>
        Absolute links, like to
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
          target="_blank"
          >Mozilla Developer Network</a
        >, which is a very good resource for web developers.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
